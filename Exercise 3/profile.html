    <p>Hello, my name is Godzilla, King of all monsters. Every few hundred years I travel to the shores of Japan to spread cultural awarencess about monster-kind. Despite this, humans often mistake me for a malevelant beast and attempt to drive me back to my home. That is why I am creating this page using the limited knowledge of HTML and CSS I picked up at Subterreanean Pacific University, Home of the Lizards. I would like everyone who visits this page to get to know a little about myself. Some of my interests include butterfly collecting, wiping out entire species, and watching the sunset while lounging out next to burning buildings. I am currently single (still miss you, Mothra) and am trying to focus on getting my acting career off the ground. Find me at you local evacuation and this time don't be afraid to come say hi!</p>
